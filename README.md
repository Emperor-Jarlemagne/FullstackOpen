# [Full Stack Open 2022](https://fullstackopen.com/en/)

"Deep Dive Into Modern Web Development" course from the Department of Computer Science at the University of Helsinki in 2022.

It serves as an introduction to modern web application development with JavaScript. The main focus is on building single page applications with ReactJS that use REST APIs built with Node.js. GraphQL, a modern alternative to REST APIs is also covered. As well as testing, configuration & environment management, and the use of MongoDB for storing the applicationâ€™s data. A section on TypeScript, React Native, CI/CD, and Containers are also explored within the curriculum. This repository contains my solutions for this course's exercises.
